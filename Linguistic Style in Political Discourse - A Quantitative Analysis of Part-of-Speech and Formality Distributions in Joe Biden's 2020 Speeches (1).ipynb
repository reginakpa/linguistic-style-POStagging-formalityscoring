    "This study explores the interplay between part-of-speech (POS) tags and formality scores in differentiating Joe Biden's formal and informal speeches. The analysis focuses on Heylighen and Dewaele's (1999) F-score to examine Biden's 2020 Democratic Convention Speech (formal) and Thanksgiving Day Speech (informal). The formality is measured by analyzing word type frequencies from different genres, aligning with the expectation that \"the more formal the language excerpt, the higher the value of F\" (Heylighen & Dewaele, 1999, p. 13). The analysis aims to contribute to understanding the role of language in shaping formality and how language is used in different contexts. The analysis reveals that Biden's Democratic Convention speech exhibited a higher F-score than his Thanksgiving speech. The difference suggests that Biden adapts his language style to suit each occasion's context or formality."

    "This study examined the formality of Joe Biden's 2020 speeches using Heylighen and Dewaele's (1999) F-score and genre-specific word frequency analysis. As expected, Joe Biden's formal Democratic Convention speech exhibited a higher formality score than his informal Thanksgiving speech. The result aligns with expectations that Biden adapted his language style to suit the formality of each setting. These findings contribute to our understanding of Joe Biden's communication strategies by highlighting his linguistic choices to adapt his message to different contexts."
